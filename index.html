      <h2>Behind the Dough</h2>
      <div class="columns">
        <p>Here's the scoop from Doughp's founder on how this flavor came to be: "I first made Red Velvet on a total whim, just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up Doughp at our original commercial kitchen in Oakland, I left to grab some lunch at a nearby bakery.</p>

        <p>I saw an absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and immediately thought: I NEED to know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the cake and mixed it right into a small 5lb batch of Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake and all! HEAVEN by the spoonful!"</p>
